# Machine Learning (NLP) - Segmentation of Medical Discharge Reports
## Brief Description
Recent advances in natural language processing, more specifically, better ways to contextualise word meaning from text and more sophisticated deep learning algorithms has seen a spike in the literature regarding the increase in both precision and recall of classifying  clinical  texts. Having already been applied to radiology and pathology reports with varying success, in this report we examine how deep learning can increase the performance of classification of medical discharge reports.
